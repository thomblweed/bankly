Heya there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to [Bud](https://www.thisisbud.com)'s takehome frontend developer showcase!

> We just wanted to say thank you for interviewing with us! The job hunting process can be a really stressful and anxious time, but we promise you, we don't bite!
>
> If there's anything you need or any accommodations we can make so you feel at ease _please_ let us know and we'll do out best to sort it!  
> ~ _Frontend at Bud_

This is way less of a test with right and wrong answers and more of us looking at:

- "How do you write code?"
- "How do you test?"
- "How do you think about accessibility?"

If you're struggling to work out what the "right answer" looks like - please don't! This codebase is really just going to be a conversation starter for our next discussion, so don't worry about perfect.

**What we are looking for is a React app based on the [tasks](./tasks) we've set out.**

There's a quite a few tasks in there - so please, feel no obligation to do all of them - keep going until you get bored or stuck and just let us know where you get upto.

You can put as much or as little into this as you'd like - so feel free to go a bit wild if you want.

**When you're finished with the exercise, please email your Bud contact with a link to your Github repository, or just attach it as a .zip file.**

Thanks!  
~ _Frontend at Bud_

### Getting setup

#### Prerequisites

- A code editor
- A modern-_ish_ version of npm & node.
- Docker (but only if you choose to run the app in a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers))

#### Installation

The application has a [dev-container](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) that enables you to get setup quickly if you're familiar with them. Your code editor might automatically find it and ask you to run it when you load the codebase.

Otherwise, you can get setup 'manually' pretty quickly too!

1. In a terminal type `npm install`
2. Wait a couple of minutes for everything to download
3. If that's all worked, that's all you need to do!
4. Type `npm run dev` and you should see a message a little like this in the terminal:

```bash
  VITE v7.1.2  ready in 921 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
```

#### Run commands

- `npm run dev` - Starts the vite server at `localhost:5173` (by default).
- `npm run test` - Runs tests, once.
- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs tests and shows the line coverage.
