# Creating a loading state

Well done! As you may have spotted, the transactions API takes a little while to respond.

Please add a loading state for the component - we have an example [loading state component](/src/components/loading/index.tsx) that you can use, or feel free to create your own.

Please write a test, showing the loading state for your component. [Please look at the api tests for a tip if you're unsure on MSW mocking.](/src/api/handlers.test.tsx)

**Why are we asking you to do this?**

- We want to see that you can handle the realities of working with APIs - sometimes they are slow, and we need to handle it!
- We need to see that you can write tests.
- We need to see you can learn how to use a (possibly) unfamiliar library, and still workout how to get to good tests.
