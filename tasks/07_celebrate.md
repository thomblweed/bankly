# Celebrate and take a well earned break

If you got made it this far... well done! Make sure to have a well earned break and a tea/coffee/whatever else.

**When you're finished with the exercise, please email your Bud contact with a link to your Github repository, or just attach it as a .zip file.**

And we'll get back to you with our thoughts and next steps sharpish. If _you_ have any thoughts on the exercise please let us know! We are always trying to improve our processes.

Thank you so much for your time and interest,
