# Creating an error state

We'd now like you to add an error state (and an accompanying test) for your components.

[You can force an error state in development with MSW by changing the status code.](/src/api/handlers.ts)

---

**Why are we asking you to do this?**

- We want to see that you can handle errors.
- We want to make sure our customers have as good a experience as possible, even when working with the 'unhappy path'.
