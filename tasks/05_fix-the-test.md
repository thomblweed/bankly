# Fix the test

Inside [the transactions test suite](/src/components/transactions/index.test.tsx) there's a skipped test because the author couldn't get it to pass, can you fix it for them please?

**Why are we asking you to do this?**

- We want to see your understanding of how tests work - especially when something _feels_ like it _should work_ but _doesn't_ or is a little unintuitive.
- Being able to pick up where someone left off is important.
