# User oriented formatting

Currently, the data being show on screen is functional, but not pretty.

We'd like to format the data based on the `en-GB` locale.

- `510.55` -> `Â£510.55` for `GBP`.
- `2022-06-24` -> `24 June 2022`.

**Why are we asking you to do this?**

- We want to make sure that our apps don't _feel_ like "frontends to a database".
- We need to make sure that we format data for the user in the way they'd expect to see it.
